# Tailfire Recipes

Recipe website without the bloated/slow/ad-infested/story-infested content that most recipe sites contain. The goal is not to drive traffic or make money, just to keep recipes in a handy format ready to use.

This is also a sandbox for me to make JS websites without a frameworkâ€”just plain ol' vanilla JS.
