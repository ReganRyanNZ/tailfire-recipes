So here is my solution: A simple, clean presentation of good recipes. No long page loads, no more internet problems (we're offline!), no disturbing pop-ups or flashing signs. You won't hear long stories about my childhood.`),
    createElement('p', `One thing you might notice is that there are no cups, teaspoons, tablespoons, or any such units in the recipesâ€”only grams. This was done for a few reasons: Less dishes to wash, less equipment to need, and dry ingredients become much more accurate (e.g. flour can be nearly double the weight compacted vs sifted). The only thing this _does_ require is a higher precision (0.1g) kitchen scales. You can get away with 1g precision, but smaller measurements like 2g of salt can be hard to measure accurately. Ideally look for a max weight of 3kg or 5kg too, as some high-precision scales are limited to 500g max.`),

You're a person too. Feel free to change recipes, or invent your own. Some might fail, but some might be a big hit. That's the beauty of it.`),
