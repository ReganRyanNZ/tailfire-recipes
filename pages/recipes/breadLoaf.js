Bread Loaf
1 large loaf
2 hours 30 minutes

- 10g *yeast*
- 360g *water*
- Pinch of *sugar*
Mix sugar, yeast, and water. Let it sit in a warm place until the yeast is foaming at the top.

- 10g *salt*
- 500g *flour* (200g whole, 300g all-purpose)
Stir salt into flour.
Add the water/yeast. Mix until it is a sticky dough.

Knead the dough thoroughly, then put in a container to rise (1 hour).
When it has doubled in size, gently knead to de-gas the dough.
Shape it into a loaf (or divide and shape into loaves), place on a baking tray and let it rise again (40 minutes)

Score the top with a knife.
Put in oven at 200ÂºC with an ice cube. Cook until bread has a golden crust (about 40 minutes).
Take out of the oven and let it cool down before serving.

tips
To get a whole wheat loaf, use 200g whole wheat flour and 300g plain flour. Whole wheat flour is a little thirstier, so you might want to add 50ml more water as well.
The ice cube in the oven increases the humidity, which allows the loaf to rise better and to form a more golden crust.
It is good to bake a solid crust into the bread, but to stop it being too tough, place the loaf in a plastic bag or covered container while it cools. This traps the moisture and allows the crust to soften. You can vary the softness of the crust by the length of time it stays sealed while cooling.
