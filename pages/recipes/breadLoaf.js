Bread Loaf
1 large loaf
60 minutes

- 10g *yeast*
- 350g *water*
- Pinch of *sugar*
Mix sugar, yeast, and water. Let it sit in a warm place until the yeast is foaming at the top.

- 10g *salt*
- 500g *flour*
Stir salt into flour.
Add the water/yeast. Mix until it is a sticky dough.

Knead the dough thoroughly, then put in a container to rise.
When it has doubled in size, gently knead to de-gas the dough.
Shape it into a loaf, place on a tray and score the top with a knife.

Put in oven at 200ÂºC with an ice cube. Cook until bread has a golden crust.
Take out of the oven and keep it in a sealed container while it cools.

tips
Swap half the flour for whole wheat flour to get a whole wheat loaf. Whole wheat flour is a little thirstier, so you might want to add 50ml more water as well.
The ice cube in the oven increases the humidity, which allows the loaf to rise better and to form a more golden crust.
After baking, it is important to keep the loaf in a covered (sealed if possible) container while it cools. This allows the crust to soften, so you don't have tough bread.`
