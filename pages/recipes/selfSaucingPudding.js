tips
The ingredients of the last step should not be stirred in, they will become a rich chocolate sauce for the pudding.
Don't worry if it seems very wet—that's by design. The key to knowing if it's done is looking at the texture in the center, rather than the outside.
Serve with a high-quality vanilla ice cream.
