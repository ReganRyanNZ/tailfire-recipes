tips
This recipe is based on an Italian flatbread called piadina. It makes a soft, chewy tortilla that will ruin store-bought forever.
All-purpose flour is fine, but 00 makes them extra soft.
A quick way to roll the tortillas is to get a rough initial shape and then use a pasta rolling machine (1 step less than pasta for thickness).
