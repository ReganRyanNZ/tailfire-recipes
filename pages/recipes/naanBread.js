Naan Bread
6 medium naan
60 minutes

- 1 tsp *sugar*
- 10g *yeast*
- 1/2 cup *warm water*
Mix together and let sit until yeast rises to the top.

- 2 1/4 cups *flour*
- 1/2 cup *plain yoghurt*
- 1/2 tsp *salt*
- 1 tbsp *olive oil*
Mix together, along with the yeast mix.
Knead, then place in a bowl to rise.

Split dough into 6 pieces, knead again and shape them into balls. Let them rest for a few minutes. Coat each ball in olive oil and flatten or roll to a pizza shape.
Place into a frying pan at high temperature.

tips
You can serve them plain, or paint them with butter (or garlic butter).
High temperatures, along with the oil coating, allow the outside to get crispy while the inside can stay soft and stretchy.
