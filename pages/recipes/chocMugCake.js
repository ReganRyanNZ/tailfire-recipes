tips
This recipe is technically a "chocolate self-saucing pudding in a mug" (but that's a very long title!), it is a cake in the middle of a rich chocolate sauce.
Don't worry if it seems very wetâ€”that's by design. The key to knowing if it's done is looking at the texture in the center, rather than the outside.
The ingredients of the last step should not be stirred in, they will become the chocolate sauce for the cake.
Any oil can be used, but avoid strong-tasting oils like olive oil.
Microwaves vary in strength, you will need to find the optimal time for your microwave.
Serve with a high-quality vanilla ice cream.
