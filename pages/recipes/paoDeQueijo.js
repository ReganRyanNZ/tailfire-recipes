Pão de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread)
40 small cheese balls
1 hour 30 minutes

- 450g *milk*
- 160g *oil*
- 10g *salt*
Boil milk, oil, and salt together, until the milk begins to rise above the oil.

- 550g *tapioca flour*
Mix liquids with tapioca into a dough.

- 3 large *eggs*
Wait until the mixture has cooled down a bit (so the eggs don't cook), then mix in the eggs.
Let the mixture rest covered in the fridge for 30 mins.

- 360g grated *mozzarella*
Mix in the cheese, and roll the dough into small balls on a baking tray.
Bake at 180ºC for about 25 minutes, until the outside is golden brown.

tips
Letting the dough rest in the fridge allows it to harden a bit, making it much easier to shape.
You can also mix in parmesan cheese for a cheesier flavor.
If you rub oil onto your hands, the dough won't stick while you are shaping the balls.
Tapioca dough is very light, be careful when you start mixing it with liquids—it may spray everywhere!
