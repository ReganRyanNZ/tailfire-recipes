Pão de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread)
1 small peach cake
1 hour 20 minutes

- 2 cups *milk*
- 1 cup *oil*
- 1 tsp *salt*
Boil milk, oil, and salt together.

- 5 cups *tapioca flour*
Mix with tapioca into a dough

- 3 large *eggs*
Wait until the mixture has cooled down a bit (so the eggs don't cook), then mix in the eggs.
Let the mixture rest in the fridge for 30 mins.

- 5 cups grated *mozzarella*
Mix in the cheese, and roll the dough into small balls on a baking tray.
Bake at 180ºC for about 40 minutes, until the outside is golden brown.

tips
Letting the dough rest in the fridge allows it to harden a bit, making it much easier to shape.
You can also mix in parmesan cheese for a cheesier flavor.
