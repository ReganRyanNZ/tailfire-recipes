Pizza
4 frying-pan-sized pizzas
45 minutes

- 5g *yeast*
- 5g *sugar*
- 330g *water*
- 25g *olive oil*
Mix everything together, let it sit in a warm place until yeast rises to the top.

- 500g *flour*
- 5g *salt*
Mix salt into the flour.

Mix all of the above together and knead the dough until it is smooth.
Cover the dough and let it rest until it has doubled in size.

- 2 cans of *(plum) tomatoes*
- *sugar*
- *oregano*
- *chili flakes* or *cayenne pepper*
Mash the tomatoes, and cook them in a pot.
Add a dash of sugar, oregano, salt, and pepper to taste. Add chili to give it a small kick.
Cook until the sauce has thickened, and is no longer watery.

Divide the dough into 4 balls.
Knead each one individually, and let them rest a couple minutes (or overnight for fermented flavor).

- *Olive oil*
- *Mozzarella*
- *Parmesan*
- *Pepperoni* (optional)
Roll a dough ball out into a pizza base, place it in a large frying pan on medium-low heat.
Coat the top of the base with a thin layer of olive oil.
Add the following layers in this order:
Sauce
Mozzarella
Parmesan
Pepperoni (optional)

- Fresh *basil*
When the base is browned underneath in the pan, move to the oven and grill at high temperature until the cheese has browned.
Serve with fresh basil leaves on top. Alternatively, mash basil leaves into some olive oil and pour that over the pizza.

tips
Warm (but do not boil) the water to make the yeast activate faster.
Dough rises at different rates depending on many factors, so it's better to visually check for the size to double, rather than depend on a specific time. However, anywhere between 20 minutes to overnight should be fine.
To stop the dough drying out while rising, you can cover with plastic wrap or simply give the dough a light coating of olive oil to stop air touching the dough.
This recipe starts the pizza in the frying pan because it's easy to assemble there, and it lets the dough cook longer than the toppings. This is an important step, because the alternative is to use a fancy pizza oven at very high surface temperatures to get the dough to cook faster than the toppings.
The layer of olive oil between the dough and the sauce is crucialâ€”it stops the sauce from wetting the dough, which would prevent it from cooking properly.
This is a basic recipe for great pizza. Feel free to experiment with toppings.
You can also experiment with different cheeses, but mozzarella gives great texture and parmesan gives great flavor.
If you're feeling fancy, use 50% all-purpose flour and 50% 00 flour.
