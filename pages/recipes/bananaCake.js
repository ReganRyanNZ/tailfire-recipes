  tips: [`The brown sugar adds a little extra moisture, but white sugar is fine as a substitute.`,
         `For creaming the butter and sugar together, a fork works great if you don't have a whisk.`,
         `To enhance the sweetness use very ripe (black) bananas.`,
         `If the butter gets too hot and melts, pop it in the freezer for a couple minutes to resolidify.`]
