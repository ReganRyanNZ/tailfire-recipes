tips
The brown sugar adds a little extra moisture, but white sugar is fine as a substitute.
For creaming the butter and sugar together, a fork works great if you don't have a whisk.
To enhance the sweetness use very ripe (black) bananas.
If the butter gets too hot and melts, pop it in the freezer for a couple minutes to resolidify.
