Burger Buns
8 large buns
60-90 minutes

- 250g warm *water*
- 32g *olive oil*
- 50g *sugar*
- 7g *yeast*
Combine in a bowl and let sit for 10 minutes

- 1 egg
- 440g all-purpose flour
- 6g salt
Add in egg, stir, then flour and salt and stir until it becomes a dough.
Preheat oven to 200ºC

Flour a surface and knead dough for 8-10 minutes.
Divide into 8, shape them into balls, and place on a baking tray.
Rise for 40 minutes (optional).

- 1 egg
- Splash of milk
Mix egg and milk together to make an egg wash.
Paint the tops of the buns with the egg wash, then stick them in the oven.
Bake for 10-12 minutes until the tops are golden brown.

tips
Flatten the dough a bit before baking—you don't want tall buns for burgers.
To get a softer bun, either grill or microwave the bun halves just before making the burger.
