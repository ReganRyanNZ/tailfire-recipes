6 bread rolls
90 minutes

- 7g *yeast*
- 240g *flour*
- 1 tbsp *sugar*
- 1/2 tsp *salt*
Mix ingredients together.

- 120g *milk*
- 60g *water*
- 2 tbsp *butter*
Stir together in a saucepan on low heat until it is warm.
Mix with the ingredients from step 1.

Knead the dough thoroughly, then put in a container to rise.
When it has doubled in size, gently knead to de-gas the dough.
Shape it into 6 balls, place on a baking dish and let them rise again.

- 2 tbsp *butter* (optional)
When the dough has doubled in size, put the buns into the oven at 200ÂºC.
Bake for about 20 mins until bread has a golden crust.
Take out of the oven and brush the tops with butter (optional).

tips
This is one recipe where "crowding the pan" is a good thing. The buns will push against each other and rise more vertically, and have softer walls with no crust.
