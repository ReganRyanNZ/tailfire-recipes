Lasagna
4-6 servings of lasanga
60-90 minutes

- 200g *flour*
- 2 *eggs*
- Pinch of *salt*
Mix everything, knead until smooth.
Roll out as thin as you can. Dust the sheets with flour to keep them from sticking.

- 500g *minced beef*
- Minced *garlic*
- 1 *onion*
Fry at high temperature in a large frying pan until the beef is covered in crispy brown bits.

- 1 medium *carrot*
- 1 medium *zucchini*
- 1 can *pasta sauce*
- 1 tsp *sugar*
- *Lemon juice*
- *Salt*
- *Pepper*
- *Chili powder*
Grate carrot and zucchini and add them to the frying pan. Add the pasta sauce.
Add the rest of the ingredients according to taste (no specific measurements).

- 50g *butter*
- 90g *flour*
- 500g *milk*
- *Salt*
Melt butter in a saucepan on low heat.
Add flour and stir until a dough has formed.
Slowly (over several minutes) add milk while stirring, until the sauce is thick and smooth.
Add salt to taste.

- 1 cup grated *cheese*
Place half the mince into a baking dish. Cover with pasta sheets, and then with half the white sauce. Repeat, so there are 2 complete layers.
Sprinkle cheese on top, and bake in the oven at 180ยบ for 20 minutes until the top has browned.

tips
The white sauce requires a lot of stirring while slowly adding the milk. If it gets lumpy, keep stirring on low heat until it gets smooth again.
A small whisk is ideal for stirring the white sauce, but a fork or spoon can also work.
This pasta is quite tough to work with, since there is low water content. If it's too difficult to work with, you can splash a tiny bit of water, or leave it for a few minutes to rest.
If you are rolling the dough with a pasta machine, try the second-to-highest setting for the final thickness. Because lasagna has multiple layers, you want each layer of pasta to be very thin.
The cheese on top can be any cheese, but a good place to start is a mixture of mozzarella and parmesan.
