English Muffins
6 english muffins
60 minutes

- 120g *water*
- 2g *yeast*
- 2g *sugar*
Mix sugar, yeast, and water. Let it sit in a warm place until the yeast is foaming at the top.

- 2g *salt*
- 350g *flour*
Stir salt into flour.

- 160g *milk*
- 15g *butter*
Melt butter, mix with milk, and thoroughly combine all ingredients together into a dough.

No need to knead the dough, just mix thoroughly, then cover and let it sit until it has doubled in size.
After the dough has risen, cut and shape into 6 patties and fry them in a pan on medium-low heat.

tips
Cover the pan with a lid while frying, it traps the moisture in and makes the muffins softer.
Wholewheat muffins can be made by replacing half the flour with wholewheat flour.
If the dough gets too deflated while handling/shaping the muffins, let it rest and rise a bit before continuing. The goal is big bubbles.
The yeast can benefit from warmer (but not hot!) water.`
