tips
This is the plain traditional recipe, but you can build on it with bacon, mushrooms, or sundried tomatoes.
For great pasta, it's worthwhile to get a pasta machine. If you don't have one, you can roll the dough very (very) flat, let it dry out for 10-20 minutes, then cut wide strips (about the width of two fingers) with a knife or scissors. These wide noodles are called pappardelle, and are much easier to handle without machinery.`
