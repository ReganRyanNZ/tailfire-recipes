    {ingredients: [`1/2 tsp *yeast*`, `1/2 cup *water*`],
     actions: [`Mix yeast in water, and let it sit until the yeast is foaming at the top. You can accelerate it with warm (not hot!) water and a dash of sugar stirred in.`]},
    {ingredients: [`1/4 tsp *salt*`, `2 1/2 cups *flour*`],
     actions: [`Stir salt into flour, so it doesn't clump together later.`]},
    {ingredients: [`2/3 cups *milk*`, `1 tbsp *butter*`],
     actions: [`Melt butter, mix with milk, and thoroughly combine all ingredients together.`, ]},
     {ingredients: [],
    actions: [`No need to knead the dough, just mix thoroughly, then cover and let it sit until it has doubled in size.`, `After the dough has risen, cut and shape into patties and fry them in a pan on medium-low heat.`]}
  ],
  tips: `cover the pan with a lid while frying, it traps the moisture in and makes the muffins softer. Wholewheat muffins can be made by replacing half the flour with wholewheat flour. If the dough gets too deflated while handling/shaping the muffins, feel free to let them rest and rise a bit before continuing.`
