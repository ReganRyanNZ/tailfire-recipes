  ],
  tips: [`Cover the pan with a lid while frying, it traps the moisture in and makes the muffins softer.`,
         `Wholewheat muffins can be made by replacing half the flour with wholewheat flour.`,
         `If the dough gets too deflated while handling/shaping the muffins, let it rest and rise a bit before continuing. The goal is big bubbles.`,
         `The yeast can benefit from warmer (but not hot!) water.`
